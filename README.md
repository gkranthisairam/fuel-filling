# fuel-filling
Inspiration
*** Our main aim is to supply the fuel, when the users ran out of fuel in their vehicles and making the users reach their destination in time ***

What it does
*** When the user is travelling towards his destination and the vehicle ran out of fuel (or) when the user stuck in a heavy traffic and the amount of fuel he had is not sufficient to reach the fuel station. He can check the nearby fuel stations through this app, and can request the amount of fuel required. As soon as the request received by the fuel station the fuel station staff accept the request, and ask the user to give the exact location, and amount of fuel required for the user. User send the location and the amount of fuel required, As per the information received by the fuel stations from the user ,Fuel station staff fill the fuel into container/bottle/cans and move towards the users location. when staff member reach the location of user, they fill the fuel in vehicle. The amount of money should be paid by the user is displayed on users device, as soon as the fuel station accept the request . ***

How we built it
To built this application we used python (kivy). In this application we share the GPS location of user to the nearby fuel station, so we also used GPS tracker in this application. GPS location sharing can be done after the user grant permission to access the location

Challenges we ran into
*** We are not accessing the data until the user give permission . We are connecting the user and near by fuel stations using GPS .***

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are providing the fuel in time when the users ran out of fuel. We connect the users and near by the fuel stations, so that the users can request the fuel stations nearby him. Sometime we forgot to check the fuel tank in our vehicles and start our journey, we come to know only when the car stops (or) when we check the fuel indicator, then we realise the amount of fuel is very low and we cannot reach the fuel station with that low amount of fuel. In that moment user can access the near by fuel station and request for the fuel.

What we learned
How to use the technology in appropriate way to contact near by fuel stations in case of an emergency or when we ran out of fuel. Sometimes during long trips we forget to check the fuel tank, With this application we can contact nearby fuel filling stations .

What's next for FUEL FILLING
This help during emergency, when we ran out of fuel. We can extend this application uses: we may also contact the mechanic when users vehicle got repair during the journey. Using this application we can contact the near by mechanics when car breakdown occurs.
